# 🚀 60 Days GeeksforGeeks POTD Challenge (Java)

> "Consistency beats talent when talent doesn’t stay consistent."

This repository contains my solutions to the **GeeksforGeeks Problem of the Day (POTD)** for 60 consecutive days.
The goal of this challenge is to build strong problem‑solving skills, master Data Structures & Algorithms, and prepare for coding interviews through disciplined daily practice.

---

## 🎯 Why This Challenge?

* Build daily coding habit
* Strengthen DSA fundamentals
* Improve logical thinking
* Learn optimization techniques
* Prepare for technical interviews & placements

---

## 🧠 How I Solve Each Problem

For every question, I follow a structured approach:

1. Understand the problem statement clearly
2. Think of a brute force solution
3. Optimize step by step
4. Perform dry run on examples
5. Write explanation in simple words
